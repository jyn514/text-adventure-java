HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Look for a NotImplementedException in the various files.
Anywhere it's called, I probably could use some help getting things running. Outside of that,
consult https://github.com/jyn514/text-adventure-java/issues or shoot me an email at jyn514 (at) gmail.com.
 
USER INSTRUCTIONS: If you're using the pre-compiled jarfile, run `java -jar /path/to/adventure.jar`.
Otherwise, compile with `javac /path/to/adventure/Main.java` and run `Main.class`.
Enjoy!
